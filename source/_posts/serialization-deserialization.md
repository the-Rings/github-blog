序列化： 将数据结构或对象转换成二进制串的过程
反序列化：将在序列化过程中所生成的二进制串转换成数据结构或者对象的过程

# Java Serialization
Serialization is the conversion of the state of an object into a byte stream; deserialization does the opposite. 
Stated differently, serialization is the conversion of **a Java object into a static stream (sequence) of bytes** which can then be saved to a database or transferred over a network.
